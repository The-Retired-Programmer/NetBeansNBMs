<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">In 2018 we saw a great revival of our Girls Go Sailing scheme, which we have run intermittently for a few years. By making it a member lead activity, we have seen increased numbers of women participating and welcome new members at any time throughout the year.</span></div>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We are offering our female members sailing opportunities on cruisers, dinghies and the club Hawk, running the sessions at varying times â€“ some weekends, some weekdays, some evenings, throughout the year.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We encourage participation in shore-based theory sessions and offer knowledge and safety seminars through the winter and spring.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">We are also planning some social evenings throughout the year.</span></li>
