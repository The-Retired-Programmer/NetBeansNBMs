<p>The RS Aero is the fastest growing fleet at Exe SC. We currently have 10 Aeros in the fleet which provides some very competitive sailing. The Aero was launched in 2014 and was designed by Jo Richards in conjunction with RS Sailing. The Aero is the 21st century Laser, it is faster, lighter and a huge amount of fun to sail from novice to experienced sailors.</p>
